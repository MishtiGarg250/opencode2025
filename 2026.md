# 2026 Ideas

## Tags & Roles

- Add role-specific tags (e.g., `Mentor`, `IIIT A`, `Visitor`) to user profiles to make roles visible in the UI.

## Leaderboard & Maintainers

- Exclude mentors/maintainers from the public leaderboard. Provide a separate maintainer view or sidebar listing repositories each maintainer oversees. Note: one repository can have multiple maintainers and one maintainer can belong to multiple repositories.

## Visual Theme

- Consider a themed UI this year and explore integrating an `r/Place`-style collaborative canvas (see: https://github.com/Paraspandey-debugs/rplace_oc).

## Badges & Rewards

- Implement client-side badges based on PR merge counts (no backend storage required). Suggested badges: `First PR Merge`, `10 Merges`, `50 Merges`, `75 Merges`, `100 Merges`, `150 Merges`, `175 Merges`, `200 Merges`.

## Repo Page

- A page containing all current Repos , their basic details and Maitianers assigned to them and their discord ids.
