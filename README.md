# Geekhaven Events Frontend 

## Root
/: Redirects to `/user/home` if `token` exists, otherwise `/auth/sign-in`.

## Auth
/auth/sign-in : GitHub OAuth sign-in screen (redirects to backend OAuth).<br>
/auth/register : New-user registration form (creates participant profile).

## User
/user/home : Event landing list with "Join" and "Leaderboard" actions.<br>
/user/leaderboard : List all events as cards linking to their leaderboards.<br>
/user/leaderboard/:eventName : Event leaderboard table + participant count.<br>
/user/profile : Redirects to `/user/profile/:githubId` from localStorage user data.<br>
/user/profile/:profileName : Public profile with banner, points, PRs, and details.<br>

## User (internal/hidden)
/user/assigned/hidden : Issue list for a repo; expects query params `repoName` and `profileName`.

(Never Used this tbh....)

## Admin
/admin/home : "Change Points" page (search PRs by GitHub ID + event, edit points).<br>
/admin/viewevents : List events with delete actions (admin-only).<br>
/admin/addevent : Create new event with logo/cover uploads (admin-only).<br>

# Advice (From terror_quota)
You can't do the frontend, because If you can then you would've been in the WebDev Wing.

So Coordinate With them, and improve the current Design. Every Year the website should be better than the last year (Follow some other theme.....Baaki It's on ur creativity).

Some Ideas are in the [2026.md](2026.md).
